              problem.
              You excel at diving into a problem unprompted, and you learn by pushing

              You will often find first responders well positioned as SREs or managing operational
              incidents.<br/>
              Working on projects that have long lifecycles will bore you, which eventually
              manifests as a lack of motivation.

              You are primarily motivated by the exploration and development of ideas.<br/>
              Idiosyncrasies present a wide spectrum of what one would consider an interesting idea:
              everything from actual academic literature to informally accrued observations over
              one's career.<br/>
              To academics, the concept is often more important than the code that instantiates it.
              Academics are a wonderful fit both on teams that don't have strong delivery goals
              (R&D) and teams that are working in cutting edge arenas where best practices aren't
              yet
              defined or widely known.<br/>
              As the name implies, many Academics have PhDs and higher degrees, and are found in
              academia.

              You are primarily motivated by the feeling of achievement as you increase your
              experience and honer their skill. <br/>
              How code is written is often more important to you than the purpose of the program.
              <br/>
              Craftspeople often champion specific practices like TDD, pair programming, or even
              agile/scrum
              methodologies. <br/>
              Mentorship, pairing, and some evangelism often come easily to craftspeople, as it
              reinforces and celebrates their skill development. <br/>
              Promoting a hack for the sake of expediency feels like a loss to you.

              You are primarily motivated by the impact that your work has on a community with which
              you identify. <br/>
              This could be a programming community, a company, or the industry in which you work.
              On small scales this manifests as mentorship; on larger scales,
              you can often find humanitarian speaking at or even organizing conferences and
              events.<br/>
              Organizational norms, company culture, and communication is a component of job
              satisfaction for Humanitarians, and the mission of the organization or the value
              supplied by the
              product are often more important to you than the code that they specifically work on.
              <br/>
              Humanitarians find sterile work conditions heavily focused on performance metrics
              (lines of code shipped, cumulative point velocity, bugs squashed, etc.) deeply
              unsatisfying.
